Nodes.js Server Hosting
--
> To host the server for our multiplayer application, we have chosen [Render](https://render.com/). Render provides us with the opportunity to host a NodeJS [server](https://supersnake-backend.onrender.com/) for free for 30 days, which is sufficient for the duration of this project.

Real-time bidirectional communication
--
> To facilitate communication between individual clients as seamlessly and quickly as possible, we have opted for Socket.IO.
> Socket.IO allows data to be sent and received in real-time between the server and clients. This bidirectional communication enables instantaneous updates on both ends.
